# Project Overview

This is my project for Feed Reader Testing. Tests created with Jasmine.


## RSS Feeds

This test checks to see if the feed is defined and that it is not empty. It also checks to see if the urls and names of the feed objets are defined and exist as well.


## The Menu

These tests ensure that the menu is hidden by default and then will reveal itself when clicked and then hides itself if clicked again.


## Initial Entries

Checks to make sure that there is at least one article within the feed that contains the class ".entry".


## New Feed Selection

Checks to make sure that the feed changes when new feeds are loaded or changed.
